> We need to generate a CMakeLists.txt file to build pompei within eamxx.  We start by
  opening a CMakeLists.txt file in $E3SM_ROOT/components/eamxx/src/physics/pompei/

  cd $E3SM_ROOT/components/eamxx/src/physics/pompei/
  vi CMakeLists.txt

> Set the cpp source files to be compiled.  These include the interface cpp file and
  any cpp files associated with the underlying process.

set(POMPEI_SRCS
  eamxx_pompei_process_interface.cpp
  pompei.cpp
)

> Create a library from these source files to be used throughout eamxx.

# name and add the library
set(POMPEI_LIBS "pompei")
add_library(pompei ${POMPEI_SRCS})

# Make the library public and add the EAMXX_HAS_POMPEI compiler variable so we only compile pompei code when needed.
target_compile_definitions(pompei PUBLIC EAMXX_HAS_POMPEI)
target_compile_options(pompei PUBLIC)

# Link the new library to the set of shared libraries.
target_link_libraries(pompei physics_share scream_share)

> Include ScreamUtils in this build, helpful set of utilities

include (ScreamUtils)

> Add this library to eamxx_physics

target_link_libraries(eamxx_physics INTERFACE pompei)

> Now that we have built the CMakeLists.txt for pompei we need to point cmake to it.  Add `/pompei` as a subdirectory in the CMakeLists.txt
  file one directory up.

cd $E3SM_ROOT/components/eamxx/src/physics
vi CMakeLists.txt

> Add the following code to the bottom

add_subdirectory(pompei)
